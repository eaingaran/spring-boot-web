<p>The goal os this project is to provide a simple and easy template for a Spring MVC application using Spring Boot. 
What are the advantages of using Spring Boot? </p>

<ul>
<li>Zero XML configuration for your Spring MVC App</li>
<li>Easy Maven setup in a <strong>jar</strong> project which runs your Web application</li>
<li>Full support for unit and integration testing of your webapp without the need to start and stop containers</li>
</ul>

<p>For years developers have struggled to get an easy way to setup and test a Spring MVC application. Typically one had to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setup a quite convoluted pom.xml with all necessary Spring dependencies</li>
<li>Setup web.xml to register the Spring Dispatcher Servlet</li>
<li>Setup Spring application context files, controller setup files, mappings, annotations, etc</li>
<li>Come up with all sorts of boilerplate code to just be able to simulate a web request to a web controller with a proper request and response</li>
</ul>

<p>Although eventually this would work, it would require a lot of effort, especially on the testing front. I'm sure you've been there, googling ways to test a controller in an integration test with a proper request and response. </p>

<p>Now, imagine that your Spring MVC is contained in a Maven jar project, that your controller is a simple Java class with few annotations and that you can exercise it through a fully flagged servlet container like Tomcat or Jetty without having to start anything before your test or shutdown anything after the test has completed.</p>

<p>This represents the holy-grail of web applications speed of development and testing consistency.  </p>
